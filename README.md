## ðŸ§  METHODOLOGY

### SARIMAX Model

**Order Selection:**
Based on **ACF** and **PACF** analysis, the selected parameters were:  
*(p=1, d=1, q=1) Ã— (P=0, D=1, Q=1, s=5)*, accounting for the weekly pattern of 5 trading days.

**Seasonality:**
A seasonal component with a 5-day period was used to capture weekday effects.

**Exogenous Variables:**
In addition to the closing price, exogenous variables such as **open**, **high**, **low**, and **daily percentage change** were included.  
These enhance the modelâ€™s predictive power by capturing daily price behavior â€” a decision supported by **CCF (cross-correlation function)** analysis.

**Model Selection (AIC/BIC):**
After comparing multiple variations, the model with the **lowest AIC and BIC** values was chosen, as these indicate better model fit with minimal complexity.

#### Selected SARIMAX Model

| #  | Trend | Seasonal (P,D,Q,s) | AIC        | BIC    | MAE        | MSE        |
| -- | :---- | :----------------- | :--------- | :----- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 9  | c     | (0,1,1,5)          | -34.86     | -14.49 | **0.0177** | **0.0005** |

### FFNN (Feedforward Neural Network)

**Hyperparameter Selection:**
- **Input lags:** Last **7 days** used as input features to capture short-term dependencies.  
- **Architecture:** Three dense hidden layers with **64**, **32**, and **8** neurons respectively.  
- **Activation functions:**  
  - Hidden layers: **ReLU**  
  - Output layer: **Linear** (for continuous value prediction)  
- **Optimizer:** **Adam**  
- **Regularization:** **EarlyStopping (patience=15)** to avoid overfitting.

**Walk-Forward Validation Scheme:**
A key step for time-series evaluation â€” the model is **retrained sequentially** as new data becomes available.  
The dataset was divided into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets.  
The trained model generated **5-day forecasts** for the week **October 20â€“24, 2025**.

**FNN Performance:**
> **Test MSE:** 0.006761â€ƒ|â€ƒ**Test MAE:** 0.057989

## ðŸ“Š PREDICTIONS

| date       | pred_close_sarimax | pred_close_FNN |
|-------------|--------------------|----------------|
| 2025-10-20  | 513.641784         | 512.347839     |
| 2025-10-21  | 513.710796         | 511.750122     |
| 2025-10-22  | 513.666771         | 511.873840     |
| 2025-10-23  | 513.656211         | 511.680969     |
| 2025-10-24  | 513.609880         | 511.871185     |

**Forecast Summary:**
Both models show stable predictions across the 5-day horizon.  
The **SARIMAX model** captures smoother mean-reverting behavior, while the **FFNN model** slightly adjusts for recent short-term movements.

## ðŸ§¾ CONCLUSION

The combination of **SARIMAX** (for interpretable statistical modeling) and **FFNN** (for nonlinear pattern learning) provides a robust comparative framework for stock forecasting.  
While both deliver similar results, **FFNN** shows better adaptability to small trend changes, whereas **SARIMAX** maintains strong baseline consistency.
